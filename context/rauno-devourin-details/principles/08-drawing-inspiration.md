# Drawing Inspiration

## Overview

Without doubt it's never been harder to be truly original with an abundance of prior art, designers, and LLMs. Whether you recognise it or not, any work you put out there is influenced by generations of prior work.

There's this famous quote that says "good artists copy, great artists steal."

The quote is actually paraphrased, and misattributed to Picasso—the essence of this quote goes back to 1920s where T.S. Eliot, an English poet wrote:

> "Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different from that from which it was torn."

My point of view on the misquote has always been that it misses the mark—the message should be that great artists steal and elevate. I was glad to find out that the original quote nails it.

## Make It Your Own

I would often re-create other people's work to learn. It's one of the best ways to grow. You painstakingly have to solve the same design problems the original author did.

That being said, I am of the opinion that it is important to recognise and attribute credit to the sources of inspiration for your work, if the output clearly resembles the input without reasonable doubt.

The best way to go about this is to remix multiple sources of work to make something of your own.

I was listening to Last Call by Kanye West—and yes I hesitated putting this example here because of his recent behavior—but his description of the creative process captures drawing inspiration as a constant remix of prior work.

## Examples from My Work

### Logos Carousel

I want to touch on a few examples from my own work that hopefully exemplify taking an idea and iterating on it to something different.

A simple example is the Logos Carousel built under Prototypes is actually something I saw on the OpenAI website.

There's not a lot of net-new design contributed on top here from my end. But the reason I wanted to build this was not to pass it off as my own but to verify my intuition that assumed a subtle blur effect was being used.

And upon sharing it, I felt the right thing to do was to link to the source because to me it closely resembles the original.

### Home Page

The first Devouring Details home page was actually a riff off this still frame from the Coinbase branding that I saw on Behance.

I was looking for an interaction-first website experience since Devouring Details is about interaction design. Coming across this got my gears turning and ultimately the constraint that I had to include all the chapters in a single page led to a different solution.

### Line Minimap

I can't remember where I found this website, but the portfolio for Rosemary Butcher got me inspired to try some motion design for Line Minimap.

It retains some obvious visual similarities with the inspiration but I've iterated enough on motion design and structure to put some creative distance between the source and my take.

## Key Principles

### Note

1. **Recognise that you are influenced by everyone's work** - Acknowledge your influences
2. **Completely original ideas are a fantasy** - The originality lies in how you weave an idea that has been previously woven differently
3. **Good artists copy, great artists steal, exceptional artists elevate** - Take inspiration and make it better
4. **Make something of your own by remixing inspiration from various sources** - Combine multiple influences
5. **Attribute credit to people whose work you copy for learning** - You'll get a much better response from them

## Design Principles

1. **Learn by recreating** - Recreate others' work to understand the problems they solved
2. **Remix multiple sources** - Combine inspirations to create something new
3. **Attribute credit** - When output clearly resembles input, give credit
4. **Iterate and elevate** - Don't just copy, make it better or different
5. **Put creative distance** - Iterate enough to create your own take
