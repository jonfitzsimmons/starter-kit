# Interaction Metaphors

## Overview

Great interaction design rewards learning by reusing metaphors and interaction patterns. You can use most touch interfaces with just two gestures: tapping and swiping.

For example, on iOS the only gesture they used to explicitly teach users is swiping up to open.

## Key Concept

**Learning one gesture unlocks control over many other parts of the interface.**

The sliding motion also tells you that the interface is composed of stacked layers, like a deck of cards. Knowing so, you might discover other swipeable areas.

Conceptually, the interface is further implicitly teaching you that swiping down reveals layers of system functionality. This knowledge compounds as you delve deeper into the Apple ecosystem.

## Examples

### 1. iOS Lock Screen & App Dismissal

The lock screen sliding up establishes that, in essence, it's just an overlay that can be dismissed by swiping up, and within that framing so is an app. That means you also now know how to dismiss an app.

**Key Detail**: Notice how dismissing an app morphs into the Dynamic Island. The gesture retains the momentum and angle at which it was thrown. It's never perfectly centered or consistent in timing.

This movement builds on our natural sense of physics from the real world, like how swiping a playing card would feel. Although the movement of the playing card exhibits less bounce since it's conceptual.

### 2. Horizontal Swiping for Navigation

Why does swiping horizontally navigate between pages? Because that's how we've intuitively interfaced with books for thousands of years.

**Important Principle**: Great interactions are modeled after properties from the real world, like **interruptability**. This sounds kinda silly because, duh, obviously flipping a page in a book is interruptible. But imagine if it wasn't—if you had to wait for the animation to complete before you could flip again. The interaction would feel broken.

### 3. Pinching for Zooming

Pinching is another gesture that we've come to intuitively associate with zooming. Simply put, zooming is an act of precision—adjusting the amount of detail visible.

We can think of pinching akin to movements that require intricate motor skills, like picking up tiny objects or working with spices. Naturally, we pinch our fingers for higher precision.

### 4. Adapting Metaphors to Digital Mediums

At a certain point the metaphors need to be adapted to a digital medium. You can't just naively copy physical metaphors.

**Example**: 
- In the real world: You pick up a tiny object with your fingers spread apart
- On a digital screen: You initiate a pinch gesture with your fingers close together and then spread them apart

**Why?** It's by design because you are able to be more precise in where you want to zoom into with fingers close together rather than apart.

## Design Principles

1. **Reuse metaphors** - Build on patterns users already know
2. **Compound learning** - One gesture should unlock understanding of others
3. **Model real-world properties** - Like interruptability
4. **Adapt, don't copy** - Digital mediums require thoughtful adaptation of physical metaphors
5. **Precision through design** - Consider how gestures enable precision in digital contexts
